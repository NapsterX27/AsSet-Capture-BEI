# Delivery Tracker — Production Guide

Track material deliveries from a Requisition (Req), by line, with team visibility.
Live at the **Deliveries** card on the portal hub → `deliveries.html`.

## Who does what
- **Admins (updaters):** create trackers and log deliveries. Gated by an **admin
  key** — either the always-on **master key** (`ADMIN_KEY`, set on the Cloudflare
  Worker) or a **team key** you hand out from **Admin → Team access** (no
  Cloudflare needed).
- **Everyone else (team):** read-only + can submit change requests. They open the
  page and see trackers and delivery status — no key, no login, nothing to install.

## One-time setup (already done)
- Worker secret **`ADMIN_KEY`** (the *master* key) is set in Cloudflare
  (`asset-portal` → Settings → Variables and Secrets). It always works; rotate it
  there to reset everything.
- **Add teammates without Cloudflare:** sign in on the **Admin** tab, open
  **Team access → Add admin**, enter their name, and copy the one-time key it
  generates (shown once; stored only as a salted hash in `data/admins.json`).
  Give them that key to sign in. **Remove** anyone there to revoke instantly.
  (To stand up a whole separate environment for another project, see
  [`CLONING.md`](CLONING.md).)

## Create trackers (updater)
1. Sign in once on the **Admin** tab (name + **`ADMIN_KEY`**, stored per device),
   then open **Deliveries** → **New tracker** (or use the Admin tab's shortcut).
2. Drop the Req **`.xlsx`** export. The parser reads it in your browser by
   **exact column header** (column order can vary) and **groups rows into one
   tracker per Order Number**. Columns used: Order Number → **Req #**,
   Line Number, Line Description (+ Description Line 2), **2nd Item Number →
   Part #**, UM, Request Date. All other columns (Ship To, Account Number,
   Quantity, Unit Cost, etc.) are ignored — **no costs, no quantities**.
3. The preview lists every order with its line count and a **Trade** selector.
   **Assign a trade to each order** (or use **Set trade for all orders**).
   - **Exclude** any order you don't want tracked (old/completed ones) with its
     **Exclude** button — excluded orders are dropped from the count and not
     created (click **Include** to bring one back).
   - Orders whose Req # is **already tracked** (open or closed) are auto-detected
     and **hidden from the list** (they're counted as "already tracked (skipped)"
     in the summary line), so you only scroll through the **new** orders to add
     and the same order is never added twice. (Rows sharing one Order Number are
     also merged into a single tracker.)
   Then **Create N trackers** — each remaining order becomes its own tracker in
   **Active**.
   - **Very large orders** (more than 200 lines) are automatically **split into
     multiple trackers** ("Part 1 of N", "Part 2 of N", …) because a single
     GitHub Issue can't hold that many lines. They share the Req #, so re-imports
     still skip them. The preview shows "splits into N trackers" on those orders.
   - **Backfill originator:** if you re-load a file after trackers were already
     created (e.g. to add the Transaction Originator to older trackers), a
     **Backfill originator on N tracked** button appears — click it to write the
     file's originator onto those existing trackers without re-creating them.

## Log deliveries & pickups (updater)
Each line captures two events, which happen at different times:
1. Click a tracker to expand its lines.
2. **Expected qty (admin)** — when the export includes a **Quantity To Receive**,
   it **prefills Expected** on import; when it's blank, enter it manually on the
   *Expected* row and click **Set**. The line then shows
   **Pending = Expected − Delivered** (0 when fully delivered). (Unit cost is
   never read.)
3. **Deliver** — when material arrives on site, enter the **quantity delivered**
   and click **Log** on the *Deliver* row.
4. **Pickup** — when the team takes material, enter the **quantity picked up** and
   the **pickup person's name**, then **Log** on the *Pickup* row.
5. Log as many of each as needed. Line status moves **Not started → On site →
   Partial pickup → Picked up**. When **every line is fully picked up**, the
   tracker **auto-closes** to the **Completed** tab. Date + your name are recorded
   automatically on each event.
6. **Mark complete (admin):** when the Req export doesn't include every already-
   handled line, the order won't auto-close. Click **Mark complete** on the order
   header to close it manually — it moves to **Completed** (shown with a green
   accent and a "Completed" badge). The GitHub Issue is closed as `completed`.

## Team view (everyone)
- Open **Deliveries** (no unlock). Browse **Active** trackers; switch to
  **Completed** for history. **Search** by Req #/trade/originator. Click
  **Filters** (it shows a count when active) to open a compact filter bar —
  filter by **Trade**, **Originator** (the Req's *Transaction Originator*, shown
  as "By NAME"), and **Date** — a one-click **Today** or an exact **From / To**
  required-date range — then **Clear filters** to reset. Expand any tracker to see, per line: Part #,
  description, **Required** date, **Expected**, **Delivered**, **Pending**
  (Expected − Delivered), **Picked up**, **Picked up by**, and status.
- **Change a trade (admin):** each tracker header has a **Trade** dropdown — pick
  a new trade to reassign it after creation (updates instantly).
- **Overdue flags:** a line whose **Required** date has passed with nothing on
  site yet is flagged **Overdue** (orange); within 3 days it shows **Due soon**.
  A tracker with any overdue line gets an **Overdue** badge in its header.
- **Print sheet:** expand a tracker and click **Print sheet** for a clean,
  branded one-order pickup sheet (with a "Picked up by / date" column and a
  sign-off line) to carry into the field.
- **Paging:** the list shows **100 trackers per page**; use the page picker /
  ‹ › arrows above the list ("Records 1–100 of N"). Switching Active/Completed
  is instant after the first load (each tab is cached until you make a change).

## Corrections
- **Fix a mistyped pickup qty (admin):** expand the tracker, click **Edit** next
  to the pickup entry under *Picked up by*, correct the number, and **Save**
  (it asks you to confirm) — the picked-up total updates in place.
- Logged too much/little? Log an **adjusting** delivery or pickup on that line (a
  negative quantity subtracts). To remove a whole tracker, expand it and click
  **Delete order** (admin) — it leaves the app and its GitHub Issue is closed
  (labeled `req-deleted`) as a record.
- **Remove a single line (admin):** expand the tracker and click **Remove line**
  in that line's *Log delivery / pickup* cell (it asks you to confirm). Use this
  when a line is a duplicate — e.g. procurement converted a Grainger part into
  the company's stock item, so the same material shows on two lines. The line is
  dropped from the tracker and the counts update. The last remaining line can't
  be removed this way — use **Delete order** for the whole tracker instead.
- **Purge legacy (admin):** old trackers created before the current format show a
  **Purge N legacy** button on the Active toolbar — one click deletes them all
  (each issue closed as a record).

## Good to know
- **Data is public** (the repo is public): trackers contain material descriptions,
  quantities, Req #, project, ship-to — **no pricing/costs**. Don't put anything
  confidential in the Req lines.
- **List freshness:** a new/closed tracker may take a few seconds to appear for
  *other* viewers (GitHub's index) — you see your own changes instantly.
- **Browser:** reading the `.xlsx` needs a modern browser (Chrome/Edge or recent
  Safari). Nothing is uploaded — the file is parsed on your device; only the line
  data goes into the tracker.
- **Under the hood:** each tracker is a GitHub Issue labeled `req-tracker`;
  updates go through the Cloudflare Worker (`/req`, `/req/deliver`). `GET /health`
  on the Worker reports config status if something seems off.

## Troubleshooting
| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| "admin only" / can't create or log | Your `ADMIN_KEY` is wrong or was rotated — re-unlock with the current value. |
| "This browser can't read .xlsx" | Use Chrome/Edge or recent Safari (needs DecompressionStream). |
| New tracker not visible to teammates yet | GitHub index lag — refresh in a few seconds. |
| Nothing loads / errors | Check `https://asset-portal.site-asset-manager.workers.dev/health`. |
